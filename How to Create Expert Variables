    Indicator variable from thresholds: 
    
    Let’s say you’re studying alcohol preferences by U.S. consumers and your dataset has an age feature. You can create an indicator variable for age >= 21 to distinguish subjects who were over the legal drinking age.
    
    Indicator variable from multiple features: You’re predicting real-estate prices and you have the features n_bedrooms and n_bathrooms. If houses with 2 beds and 2 baths command a premium as rental properties, you can create an indicator variable to flag them.
    
    Indicator variable for special events: You’re modeling weekly sales for an e-commerce site. You can create two indicator variables for the weeks of Black Friday and Christmas.
    
    Indicator variable for groups of classes: You’re analyzing website conversions and your dataset has the categorical feature traffic_source. You could create an indicator variable for paid_traffic by flagging observations with traffic source values of  "Facebook Ads" or "Google Adwords".
    
    
    Sum of two features: Let’s say you wish to predict revenue based on preliminary sales data. You have the features sales_blue_pens and sales_black_pens. You could sum those features if you only care about overall sales_pens.
    
    Difference between two features: You have the features house_built_date and house_purchase_date. You can take their difference to create the feature house_age_at_purchase.
    
    Product of two features: You’re running a pricing test, and you have the feature price and an indicator variable conversion. You can take their product to create the feature earnings.
    
    Quotient of two features: You have a dataset of marketing campaigns with the features n_clicks and n_impressions. You can divide clicks by impressions to create  click_through_rate, allowing you to compare across campaigns of different volume.
